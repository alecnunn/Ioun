{"name":"Ioun","tagline":"Ioun is a simple, self contained, wiki platform written in Python","body":"![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alecnunn/Ioun/master/resources/ioun.png)\r\n\r\n# What is Ioun?\r\n\r\nIoun is a simple to use wiki software written in Python and powered by [Bottle.py](http://www.bottlepy.org/) and \r\n[PureCSS](http://www.purecss.io/) and several other Python libraries.  For their license information, check the `licenses` folder\r\n\r\nIoun is small enough that it is self contained.  You can run your own instance by simply running the redistributable executable.\r\n\r\nThis project is also not intended to be taken 100% seriously (not yet at least).  For the most part, I am using it as a learning experience.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nIoun is released under the LGPL v3 license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
