Ioun is a simple to use wiki software written in Python and powered by [Bottle.py](http://www.bottlepy.org/) and 
[PureCSS](http://www.purecss.io/) and several other Python libraries.  For their license information, check the `licenses` folder

Ioun is small enough that it is self contained.  You can run your own instance by simply running the redistributable executable.

This project is also not intended to be taken 100% seriously (not yet at least).  For the most part, I am using it as a learning experience.
